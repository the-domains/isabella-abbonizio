Welcome to my new website!

I am an Italian classical guitarist and musicologist currently based in New York City. My passion for music manifested early in my life and brought me to pursue both instrumental and theorical studies. After studying at the G. B. Martini Music Conservatory of Bologna (Italy) I graduated in musicology, and got the Ph.D. at the Tor Vergata University of Rome. I moved to New York City five years ago and until last year I was a Visiting Scholar at New York University's Centre for European and Mediterranean Studies. 

As a guitarist I studied under the guidance of Argentine guitarist Griselda Ponce de Leonand attended master classes with Roland Dyens, Frédéric Zigante, Piero Bonaguri, Eugenio Becherucci, Martha Masters and Joao Luiz from the Brazilian Guitar Duo. I perform both as soloist and in chamber ensembles. I is a member of the (I. Abbonizio/J. Olson) and a former member of the Brooklyn Guitar Quartet (with L. Frandsen, C. Cuestas, J. Miller). My repertoire is focused on 20th and 21st century music and I premiered a number of works for guitar. 

As a musicologist, I realized the first extensive analysis on the guitar works of Maurice Ohana (1913-1992), published in the journal Il Fronimo.

My current research interests focus on 20th century Italian and French music, colonial/postcolonial studies, Italian music and politics, musical exoticism, and music education. My works are presented at international conferences, including International Society of Musicology IMS, Italian Society of Musicology SIdM, Bristol Conference on 20th century Music and Politics. I give lectures in academic and cultural institutions, such as New York University and Guitar Foundation of America, and publish in international scholarly journals. 

I am also a professional music and guitar teacher with more than ten years of teaching experience in public and private schools, in Italy and USA. Presently I am on the faculty of the Harlem School of the Arts and CEO and co-founder of DalMaestro.

A guitar advocate, I am co-founder and co-artistic director of the Lanciano International Guitar Seminars with Michael Newman and Laura Oltman and the North American Correspondent for the Italian guitar magazine GuitArt.
